# PROTO Block Coding

A website built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Google's Blocky library that
provides an online block coding interface that can be used to write python code
using PROTO's MAKE embedded systems library. It is intended to be used by
elementary/middle school students who are a part of PROTO to write code in a
way independent of operating system or computer environment.
