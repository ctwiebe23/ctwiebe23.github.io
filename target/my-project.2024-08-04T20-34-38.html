      <h3>Console Application</h3>
      <p>
        Like many computer science projects, the first stage of what would
        eventually turn into my website was what is called a 'Console App'.
        Console apps read and write text directly to/from a terminal, and are a
        great way to create an interactive program quickly.
      </p>
      <p>
        In order to learn the ropes of the C# language, many of us interns
        started by creating console apps for common card or board games. I for
        instance choose to recreate the game blackjack, taking care to make use
        of every unfamiliar concept or C#-specific tool I could find mention
        of. Once we had learned the basics of the language, we then moved on to
        the project itself.

        The actually console app for my project-- which was titled '4112
        Proof-Of-Concept ETL Application - Courses.Contacts'-- looked like
        this.
      </p>
      <p>
        It would ask the user to enter a date range within the last 180 days,
        prompt them to enter their credentials (with a *very* fancy bit of code
        that hid their password behind asterisks) and then query my database
        for every entry in that given date range and output the results to a
        file.

        I learned a lot during this portion of the project-- while it might not
        look impressive, it's during this step that we created the 'backend'
        for the project that makes everything function behind-the-scenes. This
        part is what we have covered in classes at UNL so far, but with a few
        simple differences that meant I still grew a lot as a developer during
        its construction.

      <h3>Website</h3>
      <p>
        Once the base had been established, the next step was to create the
        'frontend'-- the website. This site consisted of a few different pages,
        and was built using Gallup's high standards for accessibility and some
        very exacting rules for the visual style.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gallup has a 'library' of different website components: buttons, forms,
        tables, etc-- and I had to make my site match their style, from the
        font size and colors used to the spacing between lines and the text of
        individual buttons.
      </p>
      <p>
        Learning the why behind these rules was one of the biggest things I
        learned at this internship; there is a whole world of standards and
        studies that support even the smallest of design choices, up to and
        including the text width of questions in a form.

    <div class="col-md">
      <p>
        The core of the website is what is called a 'CRUD' application:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>C</strong>reate: Add new entries to the database</li>
        <li><strong>R</strong>ead: View an entry</li>
        <li><strong>U</strong>pdate: Edit an entry</li>
        <li><strong>D</strong>estroy: Remove an entry</li>
        <li>
          <strong>L</strong>ist: View all entries (The 'L' in CRUD is silent)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This is in many ways the standard application in software development,
        and CRUD apps form the backbone of many websites (We even made a
        console app CRUD program in Comp Sci 2). With a little tweaking and a
        few modifications, you can turn a CRUD app into just about anything.

        This project didn't just build off things I already knew, though; it
        also taught be entirely new things as well. Website design was not
        something I knew how to do at all before this internship, but by the
        time I finished I was *very* proficient at making so-so websites.
      </p>
      <p>
        Making the visuals was actually the hardest part for me-- I was great
        at designing the logical operations and devising shortcuts to simplify
        complicated processes, but making a text box look nice? Impossible. I'm
        still not convinced anyone has done it yet.
      </p>
      <p>
        All in all, it was a great project. I learned a lot regarding just
        about every aspect of website design, and I am certain that the
        knowledge I've taken away from this experience will help me be a better
        coder in general, regardless of what it is I end up doing.
