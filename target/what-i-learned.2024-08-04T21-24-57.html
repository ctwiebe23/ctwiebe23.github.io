      <h3>3 Programming Languages</h3>
      <p>
        Over the course of this summer, I learned three wildly different
        programming languages and used them extensively to create dynamic
        websites.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each of these languages has a speciality that defines its role in any
        given project-- and most have alternatives or contemporaries, some of
        which I already knew and which aided in learning so much at once.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gallup uses Microsoft's .NET framework, which leaves
        <strong>C#</strong>, <strong>Blazor</strong>, and <strong>SQL</strong>
        as their languages of choice.

    </div>
    <div class="col-md">
      <h3>C#</h3>
      <p>
        C# is the main language I coded in during my internship. It is most
        comparable to the language Java, which we learn at UNL, and as such I
        had a rather easy time picking it up. It also means that skills learned
        in either help out in the other; what I learned in University helped me
        at Gallup, and what I learned this summer will help me in future
        classes.
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-md">
      <h3>Blazor</h3>
      <p>
        The language that was newest to me was Blazor-- designed as a sort of
        'add-on' to the common (and often disliked) language HTML. HTML is what
        creates the visual portion of ever website you've ever viewed, this one
        included. Blazor combines HTML with C#, allowing to make your HTML
        react to what the user does without directly coding in a scripting
        language like Javascript. In reality, it essentially just outputs
        Javascript and raw HTML anyway, but it writes that for you.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was learning Blazor that made this website possible; though it
        doesn't use Blazor itself (my operating system doesn't work well with
        the .NET framework) I used the skills I learned writing HTML the easy
        way to write it the hard way.

           width="450"/>

    <div class="col-md">
      <img src="../images/sql-code.2024-08-04T21-24-57.png"
           alt="A screenshot of some of my SQL code"
           width="450"/>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md">
      <h3>SQL</h3>
      <p>
        The last language I learned was SQL, though this was a little different.
        SQL is something that we <em>are</em> taught at UNL, but SQL isn't as
        standardized as other languages. There are a dozen different 'dialects'
        with names like 'MySQL', 'SQLite', and just plain 'SQL'-- which is
        different from the others.
      </p>
      <p>
        The dialect we learned here was different than the one Gallup uses, and
        so while I had a good start I still had some learning to do.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, what does SQL do? Good question! SQL is a language that interacts
        with databases; it stores, edits, and retrieves data in 'tables' that
        you define.
      </p>
      <p>
        For my project I had one main table-- contact information-- but it was
        split between multiple tables. There was one for countries, one for
        states, even one for different employment statuses-- and I had to
        connect (or 'join') data from different tables to properly assemble my
        contacts when I wanted to retrieve them.
      </p>
      <p>
        While the language isn't standardized, its use certainly is. There are
        almost no good alternatives to SQL and all its flavors, so getting
        extra experience with a different variation is sure to be useful for my
        future career.
