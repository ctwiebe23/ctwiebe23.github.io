      <h3>What Gallup Does</h3>
      <p>
        Gallup is most well-known for their polls: they conduct these surveys
        worldwide and the results are used to report on everything from global
        trends to changes in an individual workplace. More relevant to me, they
        have their own software and digital infrastructure that is used to
        create, host, and analyze the forms.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, these polls are not actually explicitly a part of the
        company's 'job description' as it is; rather, Gallup is hired to
        provide advice to other companies and organizations about what they can
        do to retain talent, improve their workplace culture, and attract new
        employees-- 'Workplace Advisement' as they put it.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was in pursuit of providing more accurate advice that Gallup first
        started polling people (and much of their surveys are still only
        conducted internally at client companies) but as they grew the yearly
        World Poll became a bigger and bigger thing.
