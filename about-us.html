<h1>About PROTO</h1>

<p> PROTO is a student organization at the University of Nebraksa-Lincoln with
the mission of sparking interest in STEM for the next generation of engineers,
creative thinkers, and problem solvers. </p>

<p> We aim to support primary education institutions that currently face a lack
of current STEM offerings for reasons such as existing budgetary constraints
and a scarcity of resources. It is PROTO's objective to bridge the gap between
unimaginable and possible by providing the resources, education, and expertise
to start STEM programs at these schools, from the ground up. </p>

<p> PROTO provides the unique opportunity for its members to put into practice
the education they receive in a practical and meaningful way. PROTO works with
elementary and middle school students by lighting their spark in STEM and
creating a passion for a lifetime. We do this through robotics by designing,
building and teaching our own robotics kits all in house, alleviating many
entry barriers such as cost for the youth we engage. </p>
